I have used an article for the reference to build this, and i downloaded dataset from kaggle.

I read another article or blog in which a person built a package for the desired work and later on imported that package and used it.
Here is the link of that article: https://towardsdatascience.com/building-a-better-profanity-detection-library-with-scikit-learn-3638b2f2c4c2

I find it very informative and able to learn few things from it.
